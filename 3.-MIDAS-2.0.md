# Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis 2.0

Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis ([MIDAS](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/11/1612)) is an integrated pipeline for profiling strain-level genomic variations in shotgun metagenomic data. The standard MIDAS workflow harnesses a reference database of 5,926 species extracted from 30,000 genomes(MIDAS DB v1.2).

MIDAS 2.0 used the same analysis workflow as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), and is engineered to work with more comprehensive MIDAS Reference Databases (MIDAS DBs), and to run on  collections of thousands of samples in a fast and scalable manner. This page is focused specifically on the analysis steps, and for information about the MIDAS DB, including the target layout of MIDAS DB, how to build a new database, users should refer to  MIDASDB can refer to [this page](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/4.-MIDAS-2.0-Database).

# MIDAS 2.0 Results Layout

MIDAS 2.0 contains two strain-level analysis modules: population SNVs analysis (SNPs module) and pan-genome CNVs analysis (Genes module).  Each module includes two sequential steps: single-sample analysis and across-samples analysis. 


![Figure 1: MIDAS 2.0 Analysis Modules](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/blob/master/docs/images/Fig.Modules.png?raw=true "Title")


## Single-sample Results Layout

All single-sample workflow takes as a parameter the path to MIDAS results root directory (`midas_outdir`); and together with `sample_name` constitute the unique output directory `midas_outdir/sample_name`.  All subsequent analysis steps operate within that directory.

Single-sample analysis start with identifying the list of abundantly present species by profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (subcommand `run_species`), followed by subcommand `run_snps` for single-sample reads pileup and subcommand `run_genes` for single-sample pan-gene content profiling.  

Here is an example of the results layout  of all three single-sample analysis in the local filesystem.

## Across-samples Results Layout

For a collection of samples, population SNVs and pan-genome CNVs can be estimated using subcommands `merge_snps` and `merge_genes`. User need to provide the output directory (`midas_outdir`) as the input parameter, which is the root of the layout below.

# Single-sample Analysis

Reference-based variants calling and copy number estimation requires choosing a reference genome(s) as the template. Microbiome data usually contains hundreds of species in one sample, and only species with enough reads coverage (horizontal and vertical) can be used for reliable strain-level analysis. A good reference database should be both representative and comprehensive in terms of the abundant species in the given sample. Therefore, single-sample analysis of MIDAS 2.0 start with building a sample-specific reference database of species selected via profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (Species module).


## Common Command Line Arguments

All three single-sample analysis subcommands of MIDAS 2.0 share the following command line arguments.

```
positional arguments:
  midas_outdir          Path to base directory to store results. 

optional arguments:
  --sample_name SAMPLE_NAME   
                        Unique sample identifier. The output results will be stored at 
                        midas_outdir/sample_name.  
  -1 R1                 FASTA/FASTQ file containing 1st mate if using paired-end 
                        reads. Otherwise FASTA/FASTQ containing unpaired reads.
  -2 R2                 FASTA/FASTQ file containing 2nd mate if using paired-end reads.
  
  --midasdb_name {uhgg,gtdb,testdb}
                        MIDAS Database name. If not specificed, default option is uhgg.
  --midasdb_dir         Path to Local MIDASDB. If not specified, MIDASDB would be 
                        on-demand downloaded to current directory (.).

  --num_cores INT       Number of physical cores to use (8)
  -h, --help            Show help message and exit.
  -f, --force           Force rebuild of pre-existing outputs.
  -g, --debug           Debug mode: skip cleanup on error, extra prints.
```

## Abundant Species Detection

The goal of the single-sample Species module is to quickly detect the presence of abundant species in the given sample, to better serve the needs of building proper sample-specific reference databases.  Metagenomic sequencing reads were mapped to 15 universal single copy genes (SCGs) via `hs-blastn`, and uniquely mapped read counts per marker gene were computed. And ambiguous mapped reads were then probabilistically assigned. Only species with more than two marker genes covered with more than two reads are reported in the `species_profile.tsv`. Due to the simplicity of only 15 universal SCG markers, we don't recommend using `run_species` for taxonomic profiling. 

### Sample command

  ```
  midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb --num_cores 8 /path/to/base/midas/output
  ```

### Output files

- `species_profile.tsv`: sorted in decreasing order of `median_marker_coverage`. 

   ```
   species_id  marker_read_counts  median_marker_coverage  marker_coverage  marker_relative_abundance   unique_fraction_covered
   102337      4110                28.48                   28.91            0.30                        1.00
   102506      734                 4.98                    4.98             0.05                        0.93
   ```

### Select Species for Strain-level Analysis

The panel of species eligible for strain-level genomic variation analysis is determined by the SCG profiling results. Sample-specific rep-genome and pan-genome database would be built only for the species passing the filter.  We recommend using the combination of `median_marker_coverage` and `unique_fraction_covered` as the metrics to determine the list of abundant species. However, if the goal of the experiment is to genotype low abundant species, then users need to set the parameters properly, e.g. `median_marker_coverage > 0`.  The two subcommands `run_snps` and `run_genes` share the same command line arguments for filtering species:

```
  --select_by SELECT_BY
                        Comma separated columns from species_profile to filter
                        species.
  --select_threshold CHAR
                        Comma separated cutoff correspond to select_by to filter
                        species (> XX) (2, )
```
  
An alternative way to select the species for downstream analysis is to directly provide the list of species. The species in the provided species list is still subject to the `select_threshold` restriction. Users can set `--select_threshold=-1` to escape any filters.

```
  --species_list CHAR   Comma separated list of species ids
```


## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) Calling

Sample-specific rep-genome database of the species in the restricted species profile were built, to which reads were aligned using Bowtie2. Per genomic site read pileup and nucleotide variation for **all** the species in the rep-genome database are reported by MIDAS 2.0.  MIDAS 2.0 purposely hold any species selection based on the pileup results until across-samples SNVs analysis. That being said, per species reads mapping summary are reported in `snps_summay.tsv`, and pileup and variants calling results are organized by species; therefore users can easily select species accordingly based on the reported `horizontal_coverage` and `vertical_coverage` in the `snps_summary.tsv`.

### Sample command

- Single-sample SNVs calling for all the species in the restricted species profile: `median_marker_coverage` > 2 and `unique_fraction_covered` > 0.5
   
   ```
   midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2\
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 8 /path/to/base/midas/output

   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
         --num_cores 12 /path/to/base/midas/output
    ```

- Single-sample SNVs calling with prebuilt rep-genome database. Species module is no longer needed.

  - `--select_threshold=-1`: escape species selection filters based on the SCG species profiling. Pilup would be performed for all the species in the user-provided Bowtie2 databases.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_indexes /path/to/prebuilt/bowtie2_index \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_species /path/to/list/of/species/in/bowtie2_index \
          --select_threshold=-1 \
          --num_cores 12 /path/to/base/midas/output
   ``` 

### Output files

- Reads mapping and pileup summary: `snps_summary.tsv`

   ```

   ```

- Per-species reads pileup results: `{species}.snps.tsv.lz4`

   ```
   ref_id                    ref_pos   ref_allele  depth   count_a  count_c  count_g  count_t
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG144544_1   881435    T           11      0        0        0        11
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG144544_1   881436    T           13      0        5        0        8

   ```

- In the advanced mode (`--advanced`), the per-species pileup results would also report the called variants for **all** the genomic sites. We recommend setting `--ignore_ambiguous` to avoid falsely calling major/minor allele for site with read counts ties (e.g. ref_position: 881437).

   ```
   ref_id                    ref_pos   ref_allele  depth   count_a  count_c  count_g  count_t  major_allele  minor_allele  major_allele_freq  minor_allele_freq  allele_counts

   gnl|Prokka|UHGG144544_1   881437    T           12      0        6        0        6        C             T             0.500              0.500              2
   ```

## Pangenome Profiling

Species-level pangenome refers to the set of non-redundant genes (centroids) clustered from all the genomes within one species cluster. Species in the restricted species profile would be concatenated and used to build the sample-specific pangenome database, to which reads were aligned using Bowtie2. Per species per centroid **copy number** were computed in three steps: (1) Per centroid, reads alignment metrics, .e.g `mapped reads` and `mean coverage`, were computed; (2) Per species, median reads coverage of all the mapped centroids corresponding to the 15 universal single-copy genes (SCGs); (3) Per centroid, `copy number` were computed and gene presence/absence were inferred.

### Sample command

   ```
   midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 8 /path/to/base/midas/output

   midas2 run_genes --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
          --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
          --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
          --num_cores 12 /path/to/base/midas/output
   ```

### Output files

- Reads mapping and gene coverage summary: `genes_summary.tsv`. 

  - By default, reads aligned to more than one genomic location equally well (`MAPQ=0, 1`) are ignored.

# Across-samples Analysis

Population metagenomic SNVs calling and pangenome CNVs estimation can be accomplished by merging single-sample analysis results using the subcommands `merge_snps` and `merge_genes`.  All across-samples subcommands require the input file `samples_list`: a TSV file with `sample_name` and single-sample midas output directory `midas_outdir`. For example, given the following `samples_list`, `merge_snps` would expect to locate `/home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample/SRR172903/snps/snps_summary.tsv`, generated by `run_snps`.

   ```
   sample_name   midas_outdir
   SRR172902     /home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample
   SRR172903     /home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample
   ```


## Population SNVs Calling

1. **<species, sub-samples-lists> selection**

   As mentioned in the single-sample step, MIDAS 2.0 purposely hold any filter upon the single-sample pileup summary until the across-samples step.  The across-samples SNPs analysis restricts attention to "sufficiently well" covered species in "sufficiently many" samples. To be specific, only <species, sample> pair with more than 40% horizontal genome coverage (`fraction_covered`) and 5X vertical genome coverage (`mean_coverage`) would be kept. Furthermore, only "sufficiently prevalent" species with "sufficiently many" (`sample_counts`) would be included for the population SNVs analysis. Therefore, different species may have different lists of relevant samples.


2. **<site, relevant sample> selection**

   For each genomic site, a sample is considered to be "relevant" if the corresponding site read depth falls between the range defined by the input parameters `site_depth` and `site_ratio * genome_depth`; otherwise ignored for the pooled-SNPs compute.  Therefore, different genomic sites from the same species may have different panels of "relevant samples".  And genomic site prevalence can be computed as the ratio of the number of relevant samples for the given site over the total number of relevant samples for the given species.

3. **Relevant site** 

   For each species, a site is considered to be "relevant" if the site prevalence meets the range defined by the input argument `snv_type` and `site_prev`. 


4. **Population SNVs**

   (1) For each **relevant** genomic site, MIDAS 2.0 determines the set of alleles present across **all** relevant samples. Specifically, for each allele (A, C, G, T), `merge_snps` subcommand (1) counts the sample counts (sc) of **relevant samples** containing corresponding allele (`scA:scT`), and (2) sums up the read counts (rc) of the corresponding allele across all the relevant samples (`rc_G:rc_T`).

   ```
   site_id                            rc_A  rc_C  rc_G  rc_T  sc_A  sc_C  sc_G  sc_T
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_14|34360|A   26    10    0     0     2     2     0     0
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_11|83994|T   0     0     11    45    0     0     2     2
   ```

   (2) Across-samples major and minor allele for a single site can be computed by the metric specified via the `snps_pooled_method`: sample counts as in `prevalence` and read counts as in `abundance`. For example, the population major allele of site UHGG143484_1|905|T in the above example is T defined by accumulated read counts and C defined by accumulated sample counts. And the population minor allele refers to the second most prevalent/abundant allele.  

   (3) The sample by site matrix of the corresponding site depths and allele frequency of the above calculated across-samples minor allele for each sample will be collected and reported.

   More details about the compute can be found at [Cross-Sample SNP Analysis Tools (xsnp)](https://github.com/czbiohub/xsnp/wiki/Data-Schema-And-Computation)

## Population CNVs Profiling

MIDAS 2.0 `merge_gene` subcommands merge single-sample gene content profiling results across all the samples listed in the `samples_list`, and further on quantify each gene's presence/absence by compare the `copy_number` with the user defined minimal gene copy number to call a gene present (`min_copy`).


### Sample command

   ```
   midas2 merge_genes --samples_list /path/to/sample/lists --num_cores 8 /path/to/merged/midas/outdir
   ```

### Target output files
