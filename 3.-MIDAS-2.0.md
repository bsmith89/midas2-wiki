# Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis 2.0

Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis ([MIDAS](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/11/1612)) is an integrated pipeline for profiling strain-level genomic variations in shotgun metagenomic data. The standard MIDAS workflow harnesses a reference database of 5,926 species extracted from 30,000 genomes (MIDAS DB v1.2).

MIDAS 2.0 used the same analysis workflow as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), and is engineered to work with more comprehensive MIDAS Reference Databases (MIDAS DBs), and to run on  collections of thousands of samples in a fast and scalable manner. This page is focused specifically on the analysis steps, and for information about the MIDAS DB, including the target layout of MIDAS DB, how to build a new database, users should refer to  MIDASDB can refer to [this page](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/4.-MIDAS-2.0-Database). 


## MIDAS 2.0 Workflow

MIDAS 2.0 contains two strain-level reads-to-table analysis modules: population SNVs analysis (SNV module) and pan-genome CNVs analysis (CNV module).  Each module includes two sequential steps: single-sample analysis and across-samples analysis.

## MIDAS 2.0 Results Layout

### Results Directory

MIDAS 2.0 writes its outputs to a user-specified root directory, which is always passed as a mandatory argument to each of the MIDAS 2.0 command. In this documentation we refer to this directory as:
- `midas_outdir=/path/to/results/root/directory` 

Together with the unique sample name:
- `sample_name=/unique/id/of/sample` 

`${midas_outdir}/${sample_name}` constitute the unique output directory for single-sample analysis. All subsequent analysis steps operate within this directory. For the across-samples SNV or CNV analysis, all subsequent analysis steps operate within the directory `${midas_outdir}`.


### Single-Sample Results Layout

MIDAS 2.0 analysis usually starts with the "database customization" which selects sufficiently abundant species in each sample (subcommand `run_species`). After completing this step, users can run either of two strain-level analysis: `run_snps` for single-sample read pileup (SNV module) or `run_genes for pan-gene profiling (CNV module).  Here is an example of the results layout of all single-sample analysis in the local filesystem.

     |- genes/pangenomes.*                   run_genes         Sample-specific pan-genome database
```

### Across-Samples Results Layout

For a collection of samples, population SNVs and pan-genome CNVs can be estimated using subcommands `merge_snps` and `merge_genes`.
