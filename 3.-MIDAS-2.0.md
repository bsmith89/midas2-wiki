# Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis 2.0

Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis ([MIDAS](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/11/1612)) is an integrated pipeline for profiling strain-level genomic variation and gene copy number variations (CNVs) for metagenomics data. Its analysis steps are run against a database of 5,926 bacterial species extracted from 30,000 genomes (MIDAS DB v1.2).

MIDAS 2.0 represent a reimplementation of the same analysis steps as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), but able to operate on the more comprehensive MIDAS Databases for a larger collection of samples in a fast and scalable manner. Similar to the original MIDAS, MIDAS 2.0 also presuppose a database construction step has already taken place. This page is focused specifically on the analysis steps, and database construction steps can refer [here](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/MIDAS-DB).

# MIDAS 2.0 Results Layout

MIDAS 2.0 contains two strain-level analysis modules: population SNVs analysis (SNPs module) and pan-genome CNVs analysis (Genes module).  Each module includes two sequential steps: single-sample analysis and across-samples analysis. 

[insert a figure here.]

## Single-sample Results Layout

All single-sample workflow takes as a parameter the path to MIDAS results root directory (`midas_outdir`); and together with `sample_name` constitute the unique output directory `output_dir`:=`midas_outdir/sample_name`.  All subsequent analysis steps operate within that directory.

Single-sample analysis start with identifing the list of abundantly present species by profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (subcommand `run_species`), followed by subcommand `run_snps` for single-sample reads pileup and subcommand `run_genes` for single-sample pan-gene coverage profiling.  

Here is an example of layout of the results of all three single-sample analysis in the local filesystem.

# Single-sample Analysis

Reads mapping based variants calling and copy number estimation requires choosing a reference genomes(s) as the template. Microbiome data usually contains hundreds of species in one sample, and only species with enough reads coverage (horizontal and vertical) can be included for reliable strain-level analysis. A good reference database should be both representative and comprehensive of the abundant species in the given sample. Therefore, single-sample analysis started with building a sample-specific reference database of species determined via profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (Species module).
 
## Abundant Species Detection

The goal of the single-sample Species module is to quickly detect the presence of species in the given sample, to better serve of needs of building proper sample-specific reference databases.  Metagenomics sequencing reads were mapped to 15 universal single copy genes, and uniquely mapped read counts per marker gene were computed. And ambiguous mapped reads were then probabilistically assigned. Only species with more than two marker genes with more than two reads are reported. We recommend using `median_marker_coverage` and `unique_fraction_covered` as the metric to identify the list of abundant species.  Due to the simplicity of the 15 marker genes, we recommend against using the Species module for taxonomic profiling. 

### Sample command

  ```
  midas2 run_species --sample_name ${my_sample} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb --num_cores 8 ${midas_outdir}
  ```

### Output files

- `species_profile.tsv`: sorted in decreasing order of `median_marker_coverage`. 

   ```

   ```

## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) calling

Depending on the purpose of the experiment, users can choose the list of species that would be used to build the sample-specific representative genome (rep-genome) databases by setting proper `median_marker_coverage`. For example, to genotype 

 Although the default parameters for the species selection is set to detect abundant species in the sample, users can adjust the parameters to suit the purpose of their research. That being said, to genotype low abundant species, we suggested loosen the parameters to `median_marker_coverage` > 0. 

To explore intra-species variations in the sample, raw metagenomic reads were aligned to the sample-specific genome databases. Nucleotide variation for each genomic site was then quantified via pileup and allele count. Reads mapping summary for all the species in the rep-genome database were reported in the per-sample snps summary file. MIDAS doesn't apply any more filters based on the reads mapping at this stage.


### Sample command


- Perform Pileup for all the species in the restricted species profile: `median_marker_coverage` > 2 and `unique_fraction_covered` > 0.5
   
   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R2} \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 12 --fragment_length 1000 \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
          ${midas_outdir}
    ```

- Genotyping with Prebuilt Genome Database

  `--select_threshold=-1`: skip the Species module and pileup for all the species in a prebuilt Bowtie2 genome databases. Use with caution.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 $R1 -2 $R2 \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_indexes ${bt2_indexes/${bt2_name} \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_species ${bt2_indexes/${bt2_name}.species \
          --select_threshold=-1 --num_cores 12 ${midas_outdir}
   ``` 


### Output files

   ```

### New Features

- **Chunkified Pileup**

  Single-sample Pileup was parallelized on the unit of chunk of sites, which is indexed by `species_id, chunk_id`. When all chunks from the same species finished processing, chunk-level Pileup results were then merged into species-level Pileup file (`{species}.snps.tsv.lz4`).


- **Re-assign Representative Genome**

  Users can re-select representative genome by modifying the table of content `genomes.tsv` accordingly.

- **Custom MIDAS DB**

  The new infrastructure of MIDAS 2.0 dramatically simplifies the prior knowledge needed to build a custom MIDAS database. The new implementation of MIDAS DB reads in a Table Of Contents (TOC) file containing genome-to-species assignment, and a choice of representative genome for each species.

  First, generate the `{custom_midasdb}/genomes.tsv` in the following format:

     ```
     genome            species representative          genome_is_representative
     GUT_GENOME091053  100001  GUT_GENOME091053        1
     GUT_GENOME091054  100001  GUT_GENOME091053        0
     GUT_GENOME178957  100003  GUT_GENOME178957        1
     GUT_GENOME178958  100003  GUT_GENOME178957        0
     GUT_GENOME178959  100003  GUT_GENOME178957        0
     ```

  Second, collect all the representative genomes as following:

     ```
     ${custom_midasdb}/cleaned_imports/{species_id}/{genome_id}/{genome_id}.fna
     ${custom_midasdb}/cleaned_imports/100001/GUT_GENOME091053/GUT_GENOME091053.fna.lz4
     ${custom_midasdb}/cleaned_imports/100003/GUT_GENOME178957/GUT_GENOME178957.fna.lz4
     ```

  Third, run `run_snps` with `--midasdb_name {custom_midasdb} --midasdb_dir /path/to/midasdb_dir`.

## Pangenome Profiling

Similar with the single-sample SNPs module, only abundant species in the restricted species profile would be used to build the sample-specific pangenome database. For each species, the hierarchical compuation for each chunk of genes is: (1) For each gene, compute reads alignment based metrics, e.g. `aligned_reads`, `mapped_reads`, etc; (2) For all the pan-genes, compute the average vertical coverage of the 15 universal SCGs; (3) For each gene, infer the `copy number` normalized to the SGCs coverage, and quantify the pan-gene presence/absence.


### Sample command

   ```
   midas2 run_genes --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R2} \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
          --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
          --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
          --num_cores 12 ${midas_outdir}
   ```

### Output files

# Across-samples Analysis

MIDAS 2.0 can merge single-sample analysis results across multiple samples, such as performing across-samples core-genome SNPs calling, or merging pan-genome profiling results across samples. 

All three merge subcommands take a `samples_list` as the input argument, which is a TSV file with `sample name` and single-sample output directory `midas_outdir`.  For example, `midas_merge_species` expects to locate `/mnt/cz/hmp-test/SRS011134/species/species_profile.tsv`, generated by `run-species`.

   ```
   sample_name   midas_outdir

## Population SNPs Calling

For each **relevant** genomic site, MIDAS 2.0 determine the set of alleles present for that site across all **relevant** samples. For each allele A, C, G, T we count the samples that are **relevant** for the site and contain that allele, and sum that allele's depths across those samples.  Then we computed the across-samples major alleles for each genomic site, following by collecting the corresponding read depth and allele frequency for each sample.  We use one or the other of these metrics as a proxy for allele frequency, as specified by the `snp_pooled_method ` argument.

- **pipeline details**

  1. <species, sub-sample-lists> selection: the analysis restricts attention to "sufficiently well" covered species in sufficiently many samples. (`genome_depth`, `genome_coverage`, and `sample_counts`). Therefore, despite the provided list of samples by the user, different species may have different lists of relevant samples.

  2. **relevant sample**: determined by per-site sample filters. A sample is considered relevant for a given genomic site when the read depth at that site in that sample falls between the parameters `site_depth` and `site_ratio * genome_depth`. Otherwise, we won't include that sample for the compute of the pooled-SNPs for that site.

  3. **relevant site** across-samples site filters (core presets todo)

More details about the compute can be found at [Cross-Sample SNP Analysis Tools (xsnp)](https://github.com/czbiohub/xsnp/wiki/Data-Schema-And-Computation)
