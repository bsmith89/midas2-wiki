# Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis 2.0

Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis ([MIDAS](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/11/1612)) is an integrated pipeline for profiling strain-level genomic variation and gene copy number variations (CNVs) for metagenomics data. Its analysis steps are run against a database of 5,926 bacterial species extracted from 30,000 genomes (MIDAS DB v1.2).

MIDAS 2.0 represent a reimplementation of the same analysis steps as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), but able to operate on the more comprehensive MIDAS Databases for a larger collection of samples in a fast and scalable manner. Similar to the original MIDAS, MIDAS 2.0 also presuppose a database construction step has already taken place. This page is focused specifically on the analysis steps, and database construction steps can refer [here](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/MIDAS-DB).

# MIDAS 2.0 Results Layout

MIDAS 2.0 contains two strain-level analysis modules: population SNVs analysis (SNPs module) and pan-genome CNVs analysis (Genes module).  Each module includes two sequential steps: single-sample analysis and across-samples analysis. 

[insert a figure here.]

## Single-sample Results Layout

All single-sample workflow takes as a parameter the path to MIDAS results root directory (`midas_outdir`); and together with `sample_name` constitute the unique output directory `output_dir`:=`midas_outdir/sample_name`.  All subsequent analysis steps operate within that directory.

Single-sample analysis start with identifing the list of abundantly present species by profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (subcommand `run_species`), followed by subcommand `run_snps` for single-sample reads pileup and subcommand `run_genes` for single-sample pan-gene coverage profiling.  

Here is an example of layout of the results of all three single-sample analysis in the local filesystem.

# Single-sample Analysis

Reads mapping based variants calling and copy number estimation requires choosing a reference genomes(s) as the template. Microbiome data usually contains hundreds of species in one sample, and only species with enough reads coverage (horizontal and vertical) can be included for reliable strain-level analysis. A good reference database should be both representative and comprehensive of the abundant species in the given sample. Therefore, single-sample analysis started with building a sample-specific reference database of species determined via profiling 15 universal single copy marker genes (Species module).
 
## Abundant Species Detection

The goal of the single-sample Species module is to quickly detect the presence of species in the given sample, to better serve of needs of building proper sample-specific reference databases.  Metagenomics sequencing reads were mapped to 15 universal single copy genes, and uniquely mapped read counts per marker gene were computed. And ambiguous mapped reads were then probabilistically assigned. Only species with more than two marker genes with more than two reads are reported. We recommend using `median_marker_coverage` and `unique_fraction_covered` as the metric to identify the list of abundant species.  Due to the simplicity of the 15 marker genes, we recommend against using the Species module for taxonomic profiling. 

### Sample command

  ```
  midas2 run_species --sample_name ${my_sample} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb --num_cores 8 ${midas_outdir}
  ```

### Output files

- `species_profile.tsv`: sorted in decreasing order of `median_marker_coverage`. 

   ```
   species_id  marker_read_counts  median_marker_coverage  marker_coverage  marker_relative_abundance   unique_fraction_covered

   ```

## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) calling

Depending on the purpose of the experiment, users can decide the list of species upon which sample-specific representative genome (rep-genome) database would be built, and to be genotyped.  For example, with the goal to genotype low abundant species, we suggested to set `median_marker_coverage > 0`, instead of the default `median_marker_coverage > 2`.  Reads were aligned to the sample-specific rep-genome database using Bowtie2, and per genomic site reads pileup and nucleotide variation for **all** the species in the rep-genome database are reported by MIDAS 2.0.  MIDSA 2.0 purposely hold any species selection until across-samples SNVs analysis. That being said, per species reads mapping summary are reported in `snps_summay.tsv`, and pileup and variants calling results are organized by species; therefore users can easily select species accordingly based on the `horizontal_coverage` and `vertical_coverage`. 

### Sample command

- Single-sample SNVs calling for all the species in the restricted species profile: `median_marker_coverage` > 2 and `unique_fraction_covered` > 0.5
   
   ```
   midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 8 ${midas_outdir}

   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R2} \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 12 --fragment_length 2000 \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
          ${midas_outdir}
    ```

- Single-sample SNVs calling with prebuilt rep-genome database (no need to run the Species module)

  `--select_threshold=-1`: perform reads pileup for all the species in a prebuilt Bowtie2 genome databases.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 $R1 -2 $R2 \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \

### New Features

- **Chunkified Pileup**

  Single-sample Pileup was parallelized on the unit of chunk of sites, which is indexed by <`species_id, chunk_id`>. When all chunks from the same species finished processing, chunk-level pileup results were then merged into species-level pileup file (`{species}.snps.tsv.lz4`).


- **Re-assign Representative Genome**

  Users can re-assign representative genome for species of interests by modifying the table of content `genomes.tsv` of MIDAS DB accordingly.



## Pangenome Profiling

Species-level pangenome refers to the set of non-redundant genes (centroids) clustered from all the genomes within one species cluster. Species in the restricted single copy gene profile would be used to build the sample-species pangenome database, to which reads were aligned using Bowtie2. Per species per centroid **copy number** were computed in three steps: (1) Per centroid, reads alignment metrics, .e.g `mapped reads` and `mean coverage`, were computed; (2) Per species, median reads coverage of all the mapped centroids corresponding to the 15 universal SCGs; (3) Per centroid, `copy number` were computed and gene presence/absence were inferred.


### Sample command

   midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \

# Across-samples Analysis

Population metagenomic SNVs calling and pangenome CNVs estimation can be accomplished by merging single-sample analysis results using the subcommands `merge_snps` and `merge_genes`.  All across-samples subcommands require the input file `samples_list`: a TSV file with `sample_name` and single-sample midas output directory `midas_outdir`. For example, `merge_snps` expected to locate `/mnt/cz/hmp-test/SRS011134/snps/snps_summary.tsv`, generate by `run_snps`.

   ```
   sample_name   midas_outdir
   SRS011134     /mnt/cz/hmp-test
   SRS011271     /mnt/cz/hmp-test
   ```


## Population SNVs Calling


1. **<species, sub-samples-lists> selection**

   As mentioned in the single-sample step, MIDAS 2.0 purposely hold any filter upon the single-sample species pileup summary until the across-samples step.  The across-samples SNPs analysis restricts attention to "sufficiently well" covered species in "sufficiently many" samples. To be specific, only <species, sample> pair with more than 40% horizontal genome coverage (`fraction_covered`) and 5X vertical genome coverage (`mean_coverage`) would be kept. In addition, only "sufficiently prevalent" species (`sample_counts`) will be included for the compute of the pooled-SNPs  be analyzed for population SNVs. Therefore, different species may have different lists of relevant samples.

2. **<site, relevant sample> selection**

   For each genomic site, a sample is considered to be "relevant" if the read depth at that site (`site_depth`) in that sample falls between the input parameters `site_depth` and `site_ratio * genome_depth`.  Therefore, different genomic sites may have different lists of relevant samples. And genomic site prevalence can be computed as the ratio of the number of relevant samples for given site over the total number of relevant samples for given species.

3. **relevant site** 

   For each species, a site is considered to be "relevant" if the site prevalence meets the range defined by the input argument `snv_type` and `site_prev`. 


4. **population SNVs**

   For each **relevant** genomic site, MIDAS 2.0 determine the set of alleles present for that site across all **relevant** samples. For each allele A, C, G, T we count the samples that are **relevant** for the site and contain that allele (`sc_A:sc_T`), and sum that allele's depths across those samples (`rc_G:rc_T`).  

   ```
   site_id               rc_A  rc_C  rc_G  rc_T  sc_A  sc_C  sc_G  sc_T
   UHGG143484_1|810|C    0     10    0     2     0     2     0     2
   UHGG143484_1|905|T    0     10    0     86    0     3     0     2
   ```

   Then, across-samples major and minor alleles for a single genomic site can be computed by the metric specified via the `snps_pooled_method`: sample counts as in `prevalence` and read counts as in `abundance`. For example, the population major allele of site `UHGG143484_1|905|T` is T defined by accumulated read counts and C defined by accumulated sample counts. And the population minor allele refers to the second most prevalent or abundant allele.  

   The corresponding site depths and allele frequency of the above calculated across-samples minor allele for each sample will be collected. 

   More details about the compute can be found at [Cross-Sample SNP Analysis Tools (xsnp)](https://github.com/czbiohub/xsnp/wiki/Data-Schema-And-Computation)
