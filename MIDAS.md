# Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis Subcommands

The original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS) is an integrated pipeline for estimating bacterial species abundance and strain-level genomic variation, including pan-gene content and SNPs analysis.   Its analyses steps are run against a database of 5,926 bacterial species extracted from 30,000 genomes.

The MIDAS subcommands in the IGGTOOLS package represent a reimplementation of the same analysis steps as the original [MIDAS tool](https://github.com/snayfach/MIDAS), but able to operate on the more comprehensive UHGG dataset, which consists of 4,644 gut-only species extracted from 286,997 genomes.

Similar to the original MIDAS tool, the IGGTOOLS MIDAS subcommands presuppose a database construction step has already taken place.  This construction step for IGGTOOLS and the UHGG dataset is documented [here](https://github.com/czbiohub/iggtools/wiki).  It was executed in AWS using hundreds of r5d.24xlarge instances over a period of a couple of days, depositing built products in S3.  The commands below implicitly reference the products of that build.  This page is focused specifically on the analysis steps, not the database construction steps.

# Single-sample result layout

For each sample, the analysis begins with a species profiling step.  The identified set of species that are abundant in the sample is then used to perform pan-genome analysis and SNP analysis.  The results of all three steps are laid out in the local filesystem as follows.

```
Output                                               Producer             Meaning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{sample_name}/species/species_profile.tsv              midas_run_species  List of abundant species in sample

{sample_name}/snps/summary.tsv                  midas_run_snps     Summary of the SNPs analysis results
{sample_name}/snps/{species_id}.snps.tsv.lz4    midas_run_snps     Pileup results for each species_id

{sample_name}/genes/summary.tsv                 midas_run_genes    Pangenome alignment stats
{sample_name}/genes/{species_id}.genes.tsv.lz4  midas_run_genes    Gene coverage per species_id
```

Each sample analysis subcommand operates on a single sample.   It takes as a parameter the path to a unique output directory for that sample, which is the root of the layout above.

- `{output_dir}`: output directory unique for the sample, i.e., `{output_root}/{sample_name}`

The first subcommand to run for the sample is `midas_run_species`, and it will create that output directory if it does not exist.  All subsequent analysis steps operate within that directory.


# Pooled samples result layout

Results for multiple samples can be pooled using the corresponding subcommands `midas_merge_species`, `midas_merge_genes`, and `midas_merge_snps`.  The result layout for those looks as follows:

```

# midas_merge_snps

The pooled-samples core-genome SNPs calling pipeline can be broken down into the following steps:

- Given list of samples that we are interested in merging the SNPs pileup, we select pairs of <species, sub-sample-list> based on horizontal/vertical pileup coverage, and species prevalence.

- For each species, accumulate A, C, G, T read counts, compute sample counts, and collect read counts for all the samples

- For the second pass, if a genomic site pass the site filters and snp types, then compute the major/minor allele based on accumulated read counts or sample counts (from previous step).

## input files

The input TSV file include two columns: list of samples and the midas_run_snps results path.

## Species and sample filters

A species is covered "sufficiently well" by a sample when the per-sample average read depth over the species is at least `genome_depth` *and* the fraction of reference genome sites covered by at least one read is at least `genome_coverage`.

The analysis restricts attention to species that are covered sufficiently well in sufficiently many samples.  Let's call that the "relevant" set of species.  In addition, for each relevant species, the analysis only includes data from samples that cover that species sufficiently well.   

Parameters:

```
- `genome_depth`: [vertical coverage]  min per-sample average read depth (5X)
- `genome_coverage`: [horizontal coverage] min fraction of reference genome sites covered by at least one read (40%)
- `sample_counts`: "sufficiently many" samples
```

## Site filters

### Per-sample site filter:

A sample is considered relevant for a given genomic site when the read depth at that site in that sample falls between the parameters `site_depth` and `site_ratio * genome_depth`.
```
- `site_depth`: minimum number of reads mapped to genomic site (2)
- `site_ratio`: maximum ratio of site depth over genome depth (5.0)
```
For each site, we compute the number of samples where that site is relevant.  This is the `count_samples` column in output `snps_info.tsv`.

### Across-sample site filters (core presets):

A site is considered relevant for the given set of samples when sufficiently many of the samples are considered relevant for the site.
```
- `site_prevalence`: minimum fraction of samples where a genomic site pass the *site filters*
```
For each relevant site, we determine the set of alleles present for that site across all relevant samples. For each allele A, C, G, T we count the samples that are relevant for the site and contain that allele, and total that allele's depths across those samples.  We use one or the other of these metrics as a proxy for allele frequency, as specified by the `pool_method` argument.

We determine whether a site is bi-allelic or tri-allelic based on a threshold of the allele frequencies.

```
- `site_maf`: minimum pooled minor-allele-frequency of site across samples for calling an allele present (0.1)
- `snp_type`: count alleles for the site with frequency >= SITE_MAF 
```

## output files

- `merged_snps_outdir`:= `{merged_output_dir}/merged/snps`
