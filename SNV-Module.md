# SNV Module: Population Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) Calling

The SNV module proceeds in two phages: (1) single-sample read pileup (2) population variants calling across all the species. The first steps can be potentially in parallel.  We presuppose users already run the [database customization](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/Data-customization) step, and either have single-sample `species_profile.tsv` or a prebuilt Bowtie2 rep-genome database ready for the SNV module.


## Single-Sample SNV Analysis

In a standard workflow, rep-genome database of the species in the restricted species profile were built for each sample, to which reads were aligned using Bowtie2. Per genomic site read pileup and nucleotide variation for **all** the species in the rep-genome database are reported by MIDAS 2.0.  

MIDAS 2.0 purposely holds any filter or species selection upon the single-sample pileup results until across-samples SNV analysis. That being said, read mapping summary is reported in `snps_summay.tsv`, and pileup/variants calling results are reported by species. Therefore users can easily customize species selection on their own.

### Sample command

- Single-sample Pileup for all the species in the restricted species profile: `median_marker_coverage > 2` and `unique_fraction_covered > 0.5`. 

  We presuppose users already [profiling the species coverage](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/Data-customization#species-to-genotype), and expect `${my_midasdb_dir}/${sample_name}/species/species_profile.tsv` exists.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R1} \
         --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
         --num_cores 12 ${midas_outdir}         
    ```

  Users can adjust post-alignment quality filter parameters via the command line arguments, and the defaults are:

   ```
   --mapq >= 20: discard read alignments with alignment quality < 20
   --mapid >= 0.94: discard read alignments with alignment identity < 0.94
   --aln_readq >= 20: discard read alignment with mean quality < 20
   --aln_cov >= 0.75: discard read alignment with alignment coverage < 0.75
   --aln_baseq >= 30: discard bases with quality < 30
   ```

- Single-sample pileup for all the species in the restricted species profile with paired-ends based post-alignment quality filter.
  
  Users can recruit only properly paired reads for pileup, by passing the `--paired_only` with proper `--fragment_length`. In this case, the post-alignment metrics will be computed based on a read pair, instead of single read.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R1} \
         --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
         --fragment_length 2000 --paired_only \
         --num_cores 12 ${midas_outdir}         
    ```

- Single-sample variant calling for all the species in the restricted species profile with paired-ends based post-alignment quality filter.
  
  In recognition of the need for single-sample SNV calling, we added an `--advanced` mode to the single-sample SNV analysis in MIDAS 2.0 to report per species major allele and minor allele for all the genomic sites covered by at least two reads, upon which custom variant calling filter should be applied by the users. MIDAS 2.0 ignore ambiguous alleles calling, where genomic sites recruit tied read counts (`--ignore_ambiguous`)

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R1} \
         --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
         --fragment_length 2000 --paired_only \
         --advanced --ignore_ambiguous \
         --num_cores 12 ${midas_outdir}         
    ```

- Single-sample pileup for all the species in a prebuilt rep-genome database. 
  
  We presuppose users already followed the [database customization](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/Data-customization#population-specific-species-panel) step, and have the prebuilt rep-genome database located at `${midas_outdir}/bt2_indexes`. 

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 ${R1} -2 ${R1} \
         --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_indexes ${midas_output}/bt2_indexes/repgenome \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_species ${midas_output}/bt2_indexes/repgenome.species \
          --select_threshold=-1 --num_cores 12 ${midas_output}
   ```

## Population SNVs Calling Analysis 

Having run the single-sample SNV step for all the sample, users next can compute the across-sample SNV analysis using the `merge_snps` command. `merge_snps` requires a TSV file (`${my_sample_list}`) specifying the sample name `sample_name` and root output directory of single-sample SNV results `midas_outdir`. See [this page](https://github.com/czbiohub/MIDAS2.0/wiki/Common-Command-Line-Arguments#across-samples-analysis) for details.


### Important Concepts

In this section, we will introduce the species and sample filters, the genomic site filters, the compute of population SNV in MIDAS 2.0, and the chunkified pileup. Beginner users can skip this section and go straight to [Sample commands](). 

1. **<species, sub-samples-lists> selection**

   Population SNV analysis **restricts attention to "sufficiently well" covered species in "sufficiently many" samples**. 

   To be specific, a given <species, sample> pair will only be kept if it has more than 40% horizontal genome coverage (`--genome_coverage`) and 5X vertical genome coverage (`--genome_depth`). Furthermore, only "sufficiently prevalent" species with "sufficiently many" (`--sample_counts`) would be included for the population SNVs analysis. Therefore, different species may have different lists of relevant samples.


2. **<site, relevant sample> selection**

   For each genomic site, a sample is considered to be "relevant" if the corresponding site depth falls between the range defined by the input arguments `site_depth` and `site_ratio * mean_genome_coverage`; otherwise it is ignored for the pooled-SNVs compute.  

   Therefore, different genomic sites from the same species may have different panels of "relevant samples".  And genomic site prevalence can be computed as the ratio of the number of relevant samples for the given site over the total number of relevant samples for the given species.

3. **Relevant site** 

   For each species, a site is considered to be "relevant" if the site prevalence meets the range defined by the input arguments `--snv_type` and `--site_prev`. By default, common SNVs with more than 90% prevalence are reported.

4. **Population SNVs Computation**

   There are three main steps to compute and report population SNVs in MIDAS 2.0.

   First, for each **relevant** genomic site, MIDAS 2.0 determines the set of alleles present across **all** relevant samples.  Specifically, for each allele (A, C, G, T), `merge_snps` subcommand (1) tallys the sample counts (_sc_) of **relevant samples** containing corresponding allele (`scA:scT`), and (2) sums up the read counts (_rc_) of the corresponding allele across all the relevant samples (`rc_G:rc_T`).

   ```
   site_id                            rc_A  rc_C  rc_G  rc_T  sc_A  sc_C  sc_G  sc_T
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_14|34360|A   26    10    0     0     1     2     0     0
   ```

   Second, population major and minor alleles for a single site can be computed based on accumulated read counts or sample counts across all relevant samples (specified via `--snp_pooled_method`). The population allele refers to the most abundant/prevalent allele, and the population minor allele refers to the second most prevalent/abundant allele. For example, the population major allele of the site `gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_14|34360|A` in the above example is `A` defined by accumulated read counts and `C` defined by accumulated sample counts. 

   Third, MIDAS 2.0 collects and reports the sample-by-site matrix of the corresponding (1) site depths and (2) allele frequency of the above calculated **population minor allele** for each sample.


For large collections of samples, we recommend higher CPU counts and smaller chunk sizes to optimally balance memory and I/O usage, especially for highly prevalent species.



### Sample commands

- Across-samples SNVs calling using default filters.

   ```
   midas2 merge_snps --samples_list ${my_sample_list} --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \ --num_cores 32 ${midas_outdir}
   ```

- Users can customize species, sample, site filters. For example, we can
   - compute all the bi-allelic, common population SNVs (present in more than 80% of the population) from the protein coding genes based on accumulated sample counts. The minimal allele frequency to call allele present is 0.05.

     ```
     --snp_type bi --snp_maf 0.05 --locus_type CDS --snp_pooled_method prevalence --site_prev 0.8
     ```
   - consider species with horizontal coverage > 40%, vertical coverage > 3X and present in more than 30 samples; only consider genomic site with 
     ```
     --genome_coverage 0.4 --genome_depth 3 --sample_counts 30 
     ```
   - include site with minimal read depth >= 5, and maximal read depth <= 3 * _mean_coverage_
     ```
     --site_depth 5 --site_ratio 3 
     ```
   
   Now we can put all the above-mentioned filters in one `merge_snps` command:
  
   ```
   midas2 merge_snps --samples_list ${my_sample_list} \
        --midasdb_name ${my_midasdb_name} --midasdb_dir ${my_midasdb_dir} \
        --genome_coverage 0.4 --genome_depth 3 --sample_counts 30 \
        --site_depth 5 --site_ratio 3 \
        --snp_type bi --snp_maf 0.05 --locus_type CDS --snp_pooled_method prevalence \
        --num_cores 32 ${midas_outdir}
   ```
