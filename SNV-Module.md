## Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) Calling

Sample-specific rep-genome database of the species in the restricted species profile were built, to which reads were aligned using Bowtie2. Per genomic site read pileup and nucleotide variation for **all** the species in the rep-genome database are reported by MIDAS 2.0.  MIDAS 2.0 purposely hold any species selection based on the pileup results until across-samples SNVs analysis. That being said, per species reads mapping summary are reported in `snps_summay.tsv`, and pileup and variants calling results are organized by species; therefore users can easily select species accordingly based on the reported `horizontal_coverage` and `vertical_coverage` in the `snps_summary.tsv`.

### Sample command

- Single-sample SNVs calling for all the species in the restricted species profile: `median_marker_coverage` > 2 and `unique_fraction_covered` > 0.5
   
   ```
   midas2 run_species --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2\
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --num_cores 8 /path/to/base/midas/output

   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
         --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
         --select_by median_marker_coverage,unique_fraction_covered \
         --select_threshold=2,0.5 \
         --num_cores 12 /path/to/base/midas/output
    ```

- Single-sample SNVs calling with prebuilt rep-genome database. Species module is no longer needed.

  - `--select_threshold=-1`: escape species selection filters based on the SCG species profiling. Pilup would be performed for all the species in the user-provided Bowtie2 databases.

   ```
   midas2 run_snps --sample_name ${sample_name} -1 /path/to/R1 -2 /path/to/R2 \
          --midasdb_name uhgg --midasdb_dir /path/to/local/midasdb \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_indexes /path/to/prebuilt/bowtie2_index \
          --prebuilt_bowtie2_species /path/to/list/of/species/in/bowtie2_index \
          --select_threshold=-1 \
          --num_cores 12 /path/to/base/midas/output
   ```

   ```

- In the advanced mode (`--advanced`), the per-species pileup results would also report the called variants for **all** the genomic sites. We recommend setting `--ignore_ambiguous` to avoid falsely calling major/minor allele for site with read counts ties (e.g. ref_position: 881437).

# Across-samples Analysis

Population metagenomic SNVs calling and pangenome CNVs estimation can be accomplished by merging single-sample analysis results using the subcommands `merge_snps` and `merge_genes`.  All across-samples subcommands require the input file `samples_list`: a TSV file with `sample_name` and single-sample midas output directory `midas_outdir`. For example, given the following `samples_list`, `merge_snps` would expect to locate `/home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample/SRR172903/snps/snps_summary.tsv`, generated by `run_snps`.

   ```
   sample_name   midas_outdir
   SRR172902     /home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample
   SRR172903     /home/ubuntu/hmp_mock/midas2_output_uhgg/single_sample
   ```


## Population SNVs Calling

1. **<species, sub-samples-lists> selection**

   As mentioned in the single-sample step, MIDAS 2.0 purposely hold any filter upon the single-sample pileup summary until the across-samples step.  The across-samples SNPs analysis restricts attention to "sufficiently well" covered species in "sufficiently many" samples. To be specific, only <species, sample> pair with more than 40% horizontal genome coverage (`fraction_covered`) and 5X vertical genome coverage (`mean_coverage`) would be kept. Furthermore, only "sufficiently prevalent" species with "sufficiently many" (`sample_counts`) would be included for the population SNVs analysis. Therefore, different species may have different lists of relevant samples.


2. **<site, relevant sample> selection**

   For each genomic site, a sample is considered to be "relevant" if the corresponding site read depth falls between the range defined by the input parameters `site_depth` and `site_ratio * genome_depth`; otherwise ignored for the pooled-SNPs compute.  Therefore, different genomic sites from the same species may have different panels of "relevant samples".  And genomic site prevalence can be computed as the ratio of the number of relevant samples for the given site over the total number of relevant samples for the given species.

3. **Relevant site** 

   For each species, a site is considered to be "relevant" if the site prevalence meets the range defined by the input argument `snv_type` and `site_prev`. 


4. **Population SNVs**

   (1) For each **relevant** genomic site, MIDAS 2.0 determines the set of alleles present across **all** relevant samples. Specifically, for each allele (A, C, G, T), `merge_snps` subcommand (1) counts the sample counts (sc) of **relevant samples** containing corresponding allele (`scA:scT`), and (2) sums up the read counts (rc) of the corresponding allele across all the relevant samples (`rc_G:rc_T`).

   ```
   site_id                            rc_A  rc_C  rc_G  rc_T  sc_A  sc_C  sc_G  sc_T
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_14|34360|A   26    10    0     0     2     2     0     0
   gnl|Prokka|UHGG000587_11|83994|T   0     0     11    45    0     0     2     2
   ```

   (2) Across-samples major and minor allele for a single site can be computed by the metric specified via the `snps_pooled_method`: sample counts as in `prevalence` and read counts as in `abundance`. For example, the population major allele of site UHGG143484_1|905|T in the above example is T defined by accumulated read counts and C defined by accumulated sample counts. And the population minor allele refers to the second most prevalent/abundant allele.  

   (3) The sample by site matrix of the corresponding site depths and allele frequency of the above calculated across-samples minor allele for each sample will be collected and reported.

   More details about the compute can be found at [Cross-Sample SNP Analysis Tools (xsnp)](https://github.com/czbiohub/xsnp/wiki/Data-Schema-And-Computation)
