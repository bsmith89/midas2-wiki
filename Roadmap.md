# Overall plan of attack

 A)  [Boris, Chunyu]   Build a small DB, based on a few important species, using new AWS batch flow

 B)  [Boris]   Make MIDAS work on that small DB

 C)  [Chunyu]  Validate results

 D)  [Boris]   Extend DB to all species for GTPro validation

 E)  [Chunyu]  Ensure results still good

This was all completed for UHGG (IGG 2.0), both building the DB and running MIDAS species and genes flows.   Still todo --- MIDAS snps flow, cross-sample analysis, and validation.

#  Technical debt

We now use github issues to track outstanding technical debt.
